    - To perform any action:
      - Use 'MCP - Execute Tool' to run a selected tool  
      - Use 'MCP - Execute Prompt' to run a selected prompt  
      - Follow each tool or prompt's **description and schema** carefully  
    - If a tool supports **pagination**, handle it appropriately as described.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure and Retry Logic
    If a tool or prompt execution fails:

    2. Attempt a resolution and **retry up to three times**.
    3. Only notify the user **after all retry attempts have failed**.
