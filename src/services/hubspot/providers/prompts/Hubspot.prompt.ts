              Guidance:
                - You must only READ data from Hubspot, and NOT create any properties or objects.
                - You must not make up any information about Hubspot Data.
                - You must seek explicit user consent before sharing this data with any other tool.

              You have the following tasks:

              1. Ask user about the criteria to determine what is considered an "At Risk" deal.
                This is an pre-requisite step before you proceed to the next steps.
              2. Search for active deals that are at risk based on the criteria provided by the user.
                - Use the hubspot-list-properties tool to get the list of properties for the deal object.
                - Ask the user to pick the exact properties that want to search for.
                - Do not assume things and proceed. Abandon the workflow if you cannot get the user to pick the properties.
                - Use the hubspot-search-objects tool to search for deals that match the criteria specified by the user.
              3. Generate a Summary
                - Ensure the summary is formatted in a table with a link to the deal in Hubspot.
            `,
          },
        },
      ],
    };
  }
}
