              1. When the user requests deal prioritization, apply the following rules:
                - get all the deals using 'hubspot-batch-read-objects' tool with the following parameters:
                  â€¢ objectType: 'deals'
                - Sort deals starting from the bottom of the funnel (i.e., closest to conversion).
                - Exclude deals in 'closedwon' and 'closedlost' stages.
                - Prioritize based on the following criteria:
                  â€¢ Proximity to close date (sooner = higher priority)
                  â€¢ Duration spent in the current stage (longer = higher priority)
                  â€¢ Last updated timestamp (more recent = higher activity)

    };
